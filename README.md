# Machine-Learning-with-Wine-Quality
 Analyzing the "Red Wine Quality" dataset using clustering and classification techniques.


In this notebook, first we will analyze the "Red Wine Quality" dataset and we will be doing some exploratory data analysis to have a better understanding of the data we are working with. We will be using matplotlib and seaborn. Then, we will apply different clustering techniques to the dataset to try uncover possible clusters. Finally, we will use different classifier models to predict the quality of the wine.
